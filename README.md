# fish_breeding_season
Visualisation for the fishing data in Nir Stern's report: "The reproduction seasonality of the commercia marine fauna at the Israeli coasts - its temporal and spatial distribution".
The report is in Hebrew with a summary in English. It can be found here: http://mafish.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fishing_Nir_Stern_final150316.pdf

The following graph shows the season span for each species with the peak of the season marked with a point. The species scientific name appears on the y-axis and it's Hebrew name appears on the graph, with the colour of it used as indication to whether it is indigenous (blue) or exotic (red). The colour of the breeding season span indicated the habitat where this species is found:

You can see from this graph that species the live in sandy habitats tend to breed earlier than rocky habitat species.
